          This is one of the original Victorian Steam Engines installed when Tower Bridge was built. They were designed and installed 
          by Sir William Armstrong in collaboration with John Wolfe Barry. Armstrong was 
          a famous inventor from the time who developed the original hydraulic accumulator technology that Tower Bridge used. These engines are often 
          referred to as the Lungs of the Bridge: steam from the boilers is used to move each piston here. 
          The Engines operated on a 6 week cycle - one was always in operation, one on stand by, and one was in maintenance. 
          There used to be a third engine, but it was removed in 1974 - it is discussed further in the last room before returning to the gift shop.

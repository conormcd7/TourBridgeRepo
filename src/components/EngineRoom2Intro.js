          Take some time to appreciate the engines. Walk around, watch the one that’s moving and try to understand the mechanical components. 
          Be sure to watch the animations displayed throughout as well to accompany the technical concepts.

          Workers in these rooms likely preferred this 
          job over the boiler rooms for many reasons.
          It was cleaner to work in here, and cooler as well. It wasn’t nearly as rancid smelling - 
          some even described the rooms as sweet-smelling from the oil due to the stark contrast from the coal burning. 

          Press Continue when you have reached the opposite side of the first engine (right before you turn the corner to the right).
